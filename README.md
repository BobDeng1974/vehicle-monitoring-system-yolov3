 - Run Requirements File for Installing the Required Packages :
		 **If you want to run on CPU:**
					`pip install -r requirements-cpu.txt`
		**If you want to run on GPU:**
					`pip install -r requirements-gpu.txt`
<h4><u>OCR<u></h4>
 - Install Pytesseract using following steps:
			 
 - Download Pytesseract using the Below link:
			 - [Tesseract-ocr-Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tesseract-ocr-alt/files/)
			-Add **C:/Program Files/Tesseract-OCR/tesseract.exe'** to your  system variables
			- Then Install tesseract on our system by using:
						`pip install pytesseract-ocr`
<h4><u>STORAGE<u></h4>
		
 - We are using FireBase for our Storage system
 - It can be installed by following command:
		 - `pip install pyrebase`


<h1 id="steps">How to Run</h1>
		

 - Download the Model weights **trained_weights_final.h5** and **yolo.h5** from here:
		 [trained_weights_final.h5]() and [yolo.h5](www.youtube.in) and put them in **Data/Model Weights/**
 - **<u>Step 0:</u>** Change the locations of the file in the code wherever required.
 - **<u>Step 1:</u>** Images and Video to Detect should be kept in **Data/Source Images/Test Images/**
 - **<u>Step 2:</u>** If you want to Detect the Files just go to **Inference/Detector.py**
 - **<u>Step 3:</u>** If you have put **Video on Detection** , It would be open for first **15 seconds to click on the two points in frame**...for creating a line, then it will detected itself

<h1 id="working">How It Works</h1>

 - When we run the model , Number plate will be detected with an average **accuracy of 97%** of the vehicles crossing the Line drawn , Then the Number Plate will be cropped and filtered and passed through The OCR and we will get the Number plate. Then the Numbe Plate we get , then Processed through the RTO Database and If the Data is Found , Then it will be updated in the Storage as well as App too. But If No data is Found in the RTO database , then it will cause an Alert in the Admin Database in the app , and can only be resolved by Manually entering the Number plate in the App .

## Troubleshooting

0. If you encounter any error, please make sure you follow the instructions **exactly** (word by word). Once you are familiar with the code, you're welcome to modify it as needed but in order to minimize error, I encourage you to not deviate from the instructions above.  

1. If you are using [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) and are having trouble running `python3 -m venv env`, try:
    ```
    pipenv shell
    ```

2. If you are having trouble getting cv2 to run, try:

    ```
    apt-get update
    apt-get install -y libsm6 libxext6 libxrender-dev
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. If you are a Linux user and having trouble installing `*.snap` package files try:
    ```
    snap install‚Ää--dangerous vott-2.1.0-linux.snap
    ```
    See [Snap Tutorial](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/advanced-snap-usage#2) for more information.
